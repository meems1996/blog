* An introduction to OAuth providers and their importance in modern applications.
* The challenges of managing OAuth integrations securely.

## What is OAuth and What Does It Do For You

**OAuth (Open Authentication)** is an **open standard**, particularly an *authorization framework*,  that allows users to grant third-party apps access to their data without the users sharing their passwords. 

OAuth uses **access tokens** to prove a user’s identity and allow the application to interact with another service on their behalf. For example, OAuth is used when a web app requests access to a device’s camera or microphone. This is verified through a trusted authentication provider the user has already logged into.

> **What does open standard mean?** 
> Open standard is a standard (an open format or specification) that is freely accessible for anyone to use, adopt, and improve. Examples include SQL, HTML, and 5G. It is shared with the public and created or maintained through a collaborative process that encourages input and agreement from a wide range of contributors.

> **Why It Matters**
> Open standards are essential for app development and authentication. It allows developers to not be locked into a specific technology or vendor allowing for no boundaries or fewer limitations. 
> 
> **Background**
> Until 2007 [there was no open standard](https://oauth.net/about/introduction/) for API access delegation, when OAuth 1.0 was first proposed. The idea was to have a sole client grant access to multiple systems. As web apps evolved and the need to support non-browser apps increased, OAuth 1.0 was rewritten into OAuth 2.0 and introduced in 2010. 

An early OAuth implementer compares its workflow to a car's valet key. A valet key is given limited access. It lets someone drive the car but restricts access to the glove compartment or the trunk of the car. Similarly, OAuth lets users share account access with third-party apps without giving away full control. 

For example, when a user logs into Facebook, the user clicks the Facebook login button. Facebook then authenticates the user, and the app gains access with Facebook’s permission. That’s an overview of how OAuth works.
